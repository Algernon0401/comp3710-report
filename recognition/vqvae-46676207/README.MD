# Generative model of OASIS brain dataset using a VQ-VAE-2
Create a generative model of OASIS brain using a VQ-VAE-2 that has a reasonably clear image and a SSIM of over 0.6.
This implementation trains a VQ-VAE based on convolutional layers and uses a PixelSNAIL prior to generate images.
Example outputs and plots of the images generated by the model are provided.
